            TypeScript is at the heart of building reliable and maintainable web
            applications. By enhancing JavaScript with static type definitions,
            I ensure that the codebase is more predictable and less prone to
            runtime errors. This approach not only speeds up the development
            process but also results in a more stable and robust application.

          <b>TypeScript</b> is at the heart of building reliable and
          maintainable web applications. By enhancing JavaScript with static
          type definitions, I ensure that the codebase is more predictable and
          less prone to runtime errors. This approach not only speeds up the
          development process but also results in a more stable and robust
          application.
